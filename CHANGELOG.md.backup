## Release Notes

### v2.0.4 - The Stability Release

This release focuses on resolving compatibility issues and improving the overall stability of the bot. The main achievement is solving the persistent ESM (ES Module) compatibility problems that were preventing the bot from starting in many environments.

**Key Achievements:**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Zero ESM Errors**: Complete resolution of `require() of ES Module` errors
- ðŸ”§ **All Plugins Working**: Every plugin now loads successfully
- ðŸ“Š **100% Test Success**: All tests passing for the first time
- ðŸš€ **Improved Reliability**: Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Technical Improvements:**
